# Dotfiles and workstation setup
This configuration is mainly focused on development and devops.

Some of it is slightly Ubuntu or MacOS targeted, 
but most of it should work on any *nix setup.


## Goals
- Being fast and efficient with only keystrokes
- Achieving maximum portability over host operating system
- Persistence over sessions
- Agility in hyperjumping different networks like a nimble cat from outer space


Tips and questions are more than welcome!
